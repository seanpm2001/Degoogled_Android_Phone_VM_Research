# Android replacements

Here are some safer replacements for the Android operating system by Google.

[Android x86](https://www.android-x86.org/)

* [General download page](https://www.android-x86.org/download.html)

- [Download via Fosshub](https://www.fosshub.com/Android-x86.html)

- [Download via Open Source Developer Network (OSDN)](https://osdn.net/projects/android-x86/releases)

[LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/)

* [General download page](https://download.lineageos.org/)

You should do a web search to learn how to use these systems. If you don't know what to do, you should try them in a virtual machine first. These systems are not guaranteed to work on all mobile phones.

To install these operating systems on a smartphone, you need to root (jailbreak) your phone. You have to be 100% sure on this decision, as it can make the phone inoperable if done wrong, and can void your warranty.

Switching over is definitely worth it if possible. Just make sure all your apps would work first. You should do proper research before trying.

**Note:** I am not 100% sure if Android x86 can be installed on a phone. I have only ever seen it get installed in a virtual machine or on a laptop/desktop. I am 100% sure that LineageOS can be installed on some phones though.
