# Degoogled_Android_Phone_VM_Research
My research center for making a functional and reliable Degoogled Android virtual machine.

***

## Project goals

Goals for a DeGoogled Android virtual machine:

- [x] Be able to run in a virtual machine hypervisor such as VirtualBox

- [x] Successfully complete the installation process

- [ ] Run Gapps (Apps that require elevated permissions, such as PVZ2, Hulu, or other programs with anti-VM code, that can't be easily run through a virtual machine)

- [ ] Trick the virtual machine into thinking it is running on a legitimate Android device

- [ ] END GOAL: Run any APK file natively

- [ ] END GOAL: Run the system as root without breaking any programs

- [ ] END GOAL: Remove all Google/other trackers from the VM without breaking any programs

- [ ] END GOAL: Replicate the newest "smart" phone

## Android replacements

Here are some safer replacements for the Android operating system by Google.

[Android x86](https://www.android-x86.org/)

* [General download page](https://www.android-x86.org/download.html)

- [Download via Fosshub](https://www.fosshub.com/Android-x86.html)

- [Download via Open Source Developer Network (OSDN)](https://osdn.net/projects/android-x86/releases)

[LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/)

* [General download page](https://download.lineageos.org/)

You should do a web search to learn how to use these systems. If you don't know what to do, you should try them in a virtual machine first. These systems are not guaranteed to work on all mobile phones.

To install these operating systems on a smartphone, you need to root (jailbreak) your phone. You have to be 100% sure on this decision, as it can make the phone inoperable if done wrong, and can void your warranty.

Switching over is definitely worth it if possible. Just make sure all your apps would work first. You should do proper research before trying.

**Note:** I am not 100% sure if Android x86 can be installed on a phone. I have only ever seen it get installed in a virtual machine or on a laptop/desktop. I am 100% sure that LineageOS can be installed on some phones though.
