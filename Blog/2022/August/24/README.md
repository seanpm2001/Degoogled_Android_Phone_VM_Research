## 2022

### August 24th

I have recently put more efforts towards DeGoogling Android recently. I have gotten a second Android 9 virtual machine set up, and I am going to attempt to turn it into a backup of my current phone (Samsung Galaxy S20) this has been a worry for a long time.

The major goal in DeGoogling Android is to trick the virtual machine into thinking it is an actual "registered" Android device. I feel there may be workarounds for this, but I am going to continue trying to trick it. Due to planned obsolescence, time is not on my side. I figure I have about 5 years left before the whole process is cut off (Android 9 is already unsupported, after less than 4 years)

My current phone is planned to be my last Android phone. To make this achievement, I have to get the virtual machine functional. The other main problem for me is storage: the machine has a 256 gigabyte Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) and I am needing to make snapshots of it. Keeping 1 snapshot, and the virtual machine at the same time can take up to a maximum of 512 gigabytes. It may not be practical at the moment to replace my phone with it (also because my laptop has a worse battery in comparison, and doesn't have a touch screen) due to the 1.2 terabyte limit imposed on myself. I figure I am going to have to backup snapshots on a daily basis.

The Internet Archive has been down all day today, and it has been making my efforts a bit harder. I am still deciding on when I am going to boot up and setup my virtual machine. I am going to try an Android 2.3 virtual machine first to refresh myself on doing this, and have a proof of concept that my current device supports OS virtualization.
