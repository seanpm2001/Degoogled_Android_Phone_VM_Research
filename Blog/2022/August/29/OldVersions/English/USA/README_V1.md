# DeGoogling Android blog from [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## 2022

### August 29th

I did some minor updates to the project today, fixing the image links in all Degoogled Android project articles, but failing to get a video to embed locally. Maybe it just isn't a feature on GitHub yet? Here is my current attempt (inline HTML on Markdown)

```html
<video width="1920" height="1080" controls
  poster="/Degoogled_Android/ByVersion/2.3_Gingerbread/Graphics/Poster/Android2.3Install_2022August25th_Poster.png" controls>
  <source src="/Degoogled_Android/ByVersion/2.3_Gingerbread/Video/Installation/Android2.3_Installation_VirtualBox_2022August25th_Full.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p><b>If you are seeing this text, the video failed to load</b></p>
</video>
```

I also partially updated the blog today. Virtual machine work is still paused.
