## 2022

### August 26th

I temporarily paused the virtual machine part of this project today. I will still be writing documentation, but not with virtual machine data to back it up.

Why? Booting VirtualBox may have been a severe mistake, as my computer later had a series of graphical problems, crashes, and its first kernel panic (my first kernel panic to date) I really don't see it to be a coincidence that the same day I take the step to launch a VirtualBox virtual machine, that my computer would have severe problems. I was expecting a crash (that is why I saved and closed everything else first) but I never expected something this bad.

It knocked my entire workload offline for the night, and it made me fall behind on some projects. I will continue virtual machines on a different computer in the future.
