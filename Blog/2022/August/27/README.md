# DeGoogling Android blog from [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## 2022

### August 26th

Note: the previous blog for August 26th was actually an extension to August 25th. I am just not able to fix it right now.

I was able to resume work today. Following the VirtualBox incident, I had a call with tech support, they think it is a hardware issue, and I am really confused on this now.

I was able to update this project today, but not in depth. My GitHub account was recently restored. All images have restored functionality, but releases were converted to plain tags. It doesn't affect this project, but now I noted that a thumbnail used on my Android 9 guide is not functional. I will attempt to fix it soon.

### 2022 August 27th

I did not update the project today.
