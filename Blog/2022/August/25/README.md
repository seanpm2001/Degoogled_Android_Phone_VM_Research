## 2022

### August 25th

I took the extra step today and made a bootable Android virtual machine today. Of course, it was only Android 2.3, but it did serve 3 purposes:

- [x] 1. It confirmed that my computer has OS virtualization support and will not crash upon booting a virtual machine
- [x] 2. It gave me a brief preview of how my comptuer will handle virtual machines
- [x] 3. It will act as a recreation of an old Samsung Galaxy SII in my family

I saved and closed everything first as a precaution. I had a computer in the past that ran Windows 8 (later Windows 10) that would immediately blue screen when trying to boot a virtual machine. It was not the case for my System76 Pangolin.

I took a video of the installation process. I did get stuck at the beginning, and had difficulty making it bootable, but I still installed the entire system from loading the virtual machine to the menu to start Android within 2 minutes and 22 seconds. I am also happy that screencasting is so efficient on my current device, as a nearly 3 minute 1920x1080 60hz (no audio) video doesn't even come near 10 megabytes in size.

I am thinking about getting back into virtualization entirely, and not just for backing up my phone. I have plans to create some Windows and Mac OS X virtual machines. That is unrelated to this project, so I won't go further with talking about it here.

The Internet archive was back up today, I was really surprised that it was down all day yesterday and there wasn't even a single news article on it. I went and updated the guides for DeGoogling Android today.

I am unsure whether I will go for booting up Android 9.0 anytime soon. It is going to be a major resource hog, and will require me to get back to having a hard drive backup ready, as each snapshot will take up to 256 gigabytes, and will take at most 30-60 minutes to make. I want to get this right.
