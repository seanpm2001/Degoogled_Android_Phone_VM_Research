# DeGoogling Android blog from [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## 2022

### September 3rd

I did not do any work on the project today, besides making a blog entry, and updating the blog structure. I made a couple calendars today for 2022 October, 2022, November, and 2022 December. I am trying to stay consistent with this daily blog. I have been busy with other projects today. Virtual machine work is still paused. This blog has now been going daily for 1 week and 4 days (11 days)

I hope to have a more interesting entry soon. I would use different virtualization software, but I feel that OS virtualization itself is not fully supported on my System76 Pangolin laptop.
