# DeGoogling Android blog from [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## 2022

### September 4th

I did not do any work on the project today, besides making a blog entry, and updating the blog structure. I have been busy with other projects today. Virtual machine work is still paused. This blog has now been going daily for 1 week and 5 days (12 days)

I am a bit worried about the Android-x86 project not being updated, there currently isn't any other good way to virtualize Android. The last update was for Android 9 (Pie) and we are up to Android 13 now, with the support rate of new systems decreasing rapidly (Android 9 isn't even supported anymore, and it hasn't even been 4 years before they released it, to discontinue it)

I hope to have a more interesting entry soon. I would use different virtualization software, but I feel that OS virtualization itself is not fully supported on my System76 Pangolin laptop.
