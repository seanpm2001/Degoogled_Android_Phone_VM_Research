# DeGoogling Android blog from [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## 2022

### September 1st

I did not do any work on the project today, besides making a blog entry, as I am trying to stay consistent with this daily log. I have been busy with other projects today. Virtual machine work is still paused. This blog has now been going daily for 1 week and 2 days.

Recently, an application on my phone crashed, and had data corruption. It is unfortunate, but its data is not going to be properly backed up onto a virtual machine in the future. Additionally, I have noted that there are far too many apps that aren't going to work properly in a virtual machine, as they are either [tethered](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-tethers.html) or are just a web application to begin with.
