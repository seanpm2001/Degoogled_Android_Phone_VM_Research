# DeGoogling Android blog from [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## 2022

### September 2nd

I did not do any work on the project today, besides making a blog entry, and updating the blog structure. I made a couple calendars today for 2022 August and 2022 September, the first one took a long time to make, as I rewrote it 4 times due to errors. I am trying to stay consistent with this daily blog. I have been busy with other projects today. Virtual machine work is still paused. This blog has now been going daily for 1 week and 3 days (10 days)

I hope to have a more interesting entry soon.
