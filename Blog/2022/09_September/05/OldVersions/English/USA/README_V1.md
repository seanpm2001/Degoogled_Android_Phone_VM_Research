# DeGoogling Android blog from [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## 2022

### September 5th

I did not do any work on the project today, besides making a blog entry, and updating the blog structure. I have been busy with other projects today. Virtual machine work is still paused. This blog has now been going daily for 1 week and 5 days (12 days)

I am wondering if it is possible to compile Android by source and virtualize it. I feel it wouldn't work, as Android isn't really a complete open source system, I bet the GApps restriction would go in place, and you wouldn't be able to install most programs. I am wondering if a LineageOS, RemixOS, or GrapheneOS virtual machine is possible, and if it has any benefits.

I hope to have a more interesting entry soon. I would use different virtualization software, but I feel that OS virtualization itself is not fully supported on my System76 Pangolin laptop.

### Pinned comments

I am a bit worried about the Android-x86 project not being updated, there currently isn't any other good way to virtualize Android. The last update was for Android 9 (Pie) and we are up to Android 13 now, with the support rate of new systems decreasing rapidly (Android 9 isn't even supported anymore, and it hasn't even been 4 years before they released it, to discontinue it) - 2022 September 4th
