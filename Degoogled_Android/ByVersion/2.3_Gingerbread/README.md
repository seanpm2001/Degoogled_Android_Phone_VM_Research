This version is a lot easier to DeGoogle in August of 2022, as it is extremely outdated, and not supported at all by Google, so you don't really need to figure out how to trick it into being an Android device, as there is no way to access the Android Market.

As of 2021, September 27th, Google Play sign-in is impossible on Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and below, as Google ended all support for Android 2.3 and below on this day.

| Info | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Priority level:** | _high (due to simplicity and it being my first memorable Android version)_ |
| **Status:** | _Guide incomplete_ |

#### System requirements

The system requirements for Android Gingerbread are extremely low, even a mid-range computer from 2009 could virtualize it.

These requirements are not yet verified

| System | Requirement |
|---|---|
| RAM | 128 megabytes (256 megabytes to 2 gigabytes recommended) |
| Disk space | 350 megabytes (possible maximum of 64 gigabytes) |
| Processor | Unknown, guess: 1 core, 380 mhz |
| Touchscreen | Recommended, not required for some functions |
| Screen resolution | Unknown, at least 320x480, recommended: 480x800 or higher, possible maximum 1080x1920 |
| Network | No requirements, can't access anyways |
| Bitsize | x32 or higher |

#### Loading APKs

No information available.

#### Oracle VM VirtualBox

VirtualBox requires the following configurations:

| Configuration name | Condition |
|---|---|
| Paravirtualization interface (System/Acceleration) | `KVM` |
| Video Memory (Display/Screen) | `64 megabytes (minimum)` |
| Graphics Controller (Display/Screen) | `VBoxSVGA` |
| Other | `Unknown/unlisted` |

The graphics controller requirement will result in the warning `invalid settings detected` please ignore this and proceed. It is a false warning.
