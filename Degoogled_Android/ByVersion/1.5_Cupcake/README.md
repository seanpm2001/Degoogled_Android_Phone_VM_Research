This version is a lot easier to DeGoogle in August of 2022, as it is extremely outdated, and not supported at all by Google, so you don't really need to figure out how to trick it into being an Android device, as there is no way to access the Android Market.

| Info | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Priority level:** | _Very low_ |
| **Status:** | _Guide incomplete_ |
