This version is a lot easier to DeGoogle in August of 2022, as it is extremely outdated, and not supported at all by Google, so you don't really need to figure out how to trick it into being an Android device, as there is no way to access the Android Market.

As of 2021, September 27th, Google Play sign-in is impossible on Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and below, as Google ended all support for Android 2.3 and below on this day.

| Info | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Priority level:** | _Very low_ |
